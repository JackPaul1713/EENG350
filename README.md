# SEED Lab - EENG350
Systems Exploration and Engineering Design course repository.

## Description
The EENG350 repository tracks group 2's progress as we develop an automated search and rescue robot. We are split into two teams computer vision, and localization and control. The robot is meant to navigate a feild of QR codes as quickly as possible. The computer vision is written in python on a Rasberry Pi. The localization and control is written in C++ on an Arduino. The robot incorporates feedback control systems for position and velocity control.
