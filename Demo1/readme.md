# Demo 1
## Control
For this demo we implemented and angle and position based control system. This ensures the wheels do not move to their final desired positions at different speeds. The MATLAB files are for the control system simulation. The control.ino file is the actual control system. 
## Visualization
For this demo we began to work with the camera specifications to move from our 2d pixel domain to real world 3d coordinates. We used trigonometry and our camera's data sheet to relate the pixels of the aruco marker to its position relative to the camera. Then, we communicate this to be output on the LCD screen to demonstrate our accuracy.
